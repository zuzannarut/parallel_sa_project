# Problem 1: Hotspots

You need to implement the function "hotspots" in the file hotspot.h

To install parlay and download the graph files:

`> mkdir build`

`> cd build`

`> cmake ..`

To compile from inside the build folder:

`> make`

To run:

`> ./hotspots 100`

or

`> ./hotspots graph_data/com_orkut_sym.adj`

These should all run with the stub that is included but not give the right answers.
